## OneNote API Script

Hmm... Are you tired of creating multiple sections of notes in OneNote and typing the sections one by one painfully and then studying from them? Well I have a solution for you!

Feel free to clone this project and start using it right away! The best part is this project is open-sourced (Yes it is MIT licensed). So feel free to clone it and modify it to your needs. Please fork my project and like it if you find it useful. Thanks!!
